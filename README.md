## Project Description
The Movie Explorer App is a multi-page Flutter application designed to allow users to browse a curated list of movies, view detailed information about each movie, and manage their list of favorite movies. It features dynamic lists built with `ListView.builder`, data passing between screens, and app-wide navigation implemented via a Bottom Navigation Bar and Navigation Drawer.

### Key Features:
- Home screen displaying an attractive scrollable list of movie posters with titles, genres, and favorite icons.
- Detail screen providing full movie information and dynamic favorite toggling.
- Favorites screen showing all user-rated favorite movies with removal capability.
- Profile screen with static user details such as name, email, avatar, and bio.
- Navigation Drawer for quick access to Home, About, and Contact pages.
- Modular and well-documented Flutter code with reusable widgets and clear folder structure.
- Responsive, clean, and user-friendly UI adhering to Material Design principles.

This project demonstrates practical skills in Flutter UI design, state management using `setState()`, navigation routing, widget composition, and asset management.
